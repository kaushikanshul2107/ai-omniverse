<p dir="ltr"><span>AI Omniverse (or AI Austin) is committed to providing digital experiences that are accessible to all users, including individuals with disabilities. Our goal is to ensure that our website, www.ai-austin.com (the “Website”), is usable by everyone regardless of ability, device, or assistive technology. Accessibility is integral to our mission of delivering innovative AI solutions that empower people and organizations globally.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are actively working to align our Website with best practices and standards defined by the </span><span>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA</span><span>, as well as relevant sections of the </span><span>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span><span>. This process involves implementing features that support screen reader compatibility, logical keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, text alternatives for non-text content, and adaptable layouts for various devices and input modalities.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Ongoing Efforts</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Accessibility is not a one-time effort but a continuous process. Our team regularly audits and tests the Website using automated evaluation tools and manual reviews with assistive technologies. We are also working to embed accessibility into our design and development workflows, ensuring new features and updates meet established standards from the outset. While we strive for full accessibility, users may still encounter limitations due to the wide range of assistive technologies and evolving standards.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Disclaimer</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Despite our ongoing efforts, some pages or features may not yet fully conform to all accessibility requirements. Variability in browsers, devices, and assistive technologies may lead to differences in user experiences. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to enhance our accessibility.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Contact Us</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you experience difficulty accessing any portion of our Website, or if you have specific feedback on how we can improve accessibility, please contact us:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Email: </span><a href="mailto:aiomniverseteam@gmail.com"><span>aiomniverseteam@gmail.com</span></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When reporting an issue, please include the page URL, the nature of the problem, and the assistive technology you are using. Our team will investigate promptly and make reasonable efforts to provide accessible content or a suitable alternative.</span></p><br>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-a2424de3-7fff-a8e8-e399-eed37ff110b6"><span>Commitment</span><span><br></span><span>AI Omniverse is dedicated to creating a digital environment that reflects our values of inclusivity, innovation, and responsibility. We believe accessibility is essential to building technologies that serve everyone, and we will continue to invest in processes, tools, and training to uphold this standard.</span></b></p>
